# üè¢ Multi-Tenant Blog App with Subdomain Routing

A full-stack multi-tenant blog application built with **Next.js**, **PostgreSQL**, **Drizzle ORM**, and **Clerk authentication**. It supports subdomain-based multi-tenancy, allowing each user to manage their own blog instance with a unique subdomain like `user1.blogsite.com`.

## üßæ What is a Tenant?

In software architecture, a **tenant** is an individual user or organization that shares the same application but has isolated data and configurations.  
In this app:

- Each tenant has their **own blog**
- Each blog is accessible via a **custom subdomain**
- All data is securely separated per tenant

This architecture is scalable and ideal for platforms like blogging sites, SaaS dashboards, and portfolio generators.
